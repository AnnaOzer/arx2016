AGE CONTROL

According to the telomerase theory of ageing, to make our skin look young for as long as possible, we need to stabilize the number of cell divisions and to enhance the synthesis of collagen along with the strength of dermal-epidermal junction.
All the products in the UpGrade series contain carnosine, a dipeptide, which initiates the ageing process as its synthesis in the body starts to decrease. The unique ability of carnosine to prevent malfunction of cells makes your skin look much better than your calendar age would suggest it should.

UpGrade 30+ Cream
Intensive prevention of first signs of ageing.
Renovage is a new-age active ingredient, which fights stress and delays aging by stabilizing the telomeres during the cell divisions, thus increasing the lifetime of cells by 1/3.  Artemia extract has an energizing effect and protects DNA from damage. Carnosine prevents the formation of protein waste products. Hyaluronic acid and natural moisturisers rehydrate your skin. β-1,3-glucan enhances skin regeneration and natural UV protection. Vitamins E & F active complex balances the protection barrier of your skin and prevents lipids from oxidation.  Chamomile extract has an anti-inflammatory and soothing effect.

UpGrade 40+ Cream
Intensive prevention of middle-age skin changes.
Idealift enhances the production of elastin and increases “gravity control”.  Arjuna extract boosts collagen synthesis and ensures its proper structure.  Carnosine releases toxins by activating protein-degrading enzymes in your skin. An increased content of rich oils (wheat germ oil, soybean oil, avocado oil, shea oil) fills the deficit of skin lipids and provides for intensive nourishing and regeneration. β-1,3-glucan enhances regeneration processes in your skin and fortifies tissue immunity.  Vitamin E has a powerful antioxidant effect.  Vitamin F and glycolipids complex restores and enhances skin barrier properties.
UpGrade 40+ Cream smoothes and reduces wrinkles, and prevents new wrinkles from forming.

UpGrade 49+ Cream
Intensive prevention of senior-age skin changes.
ChroNOline restores the strength of dermal-epidermal junction of the skin, while cimicifuga extract, rich in phytoestrogens, improves low hormonal levels of the skin.  Carnosine extends the life span of skin cells; it helps scavenge damaged proteins and prevents age-related skin pigmentation.  Palmitoyl wheat proteins enhance the synthesis of the new fibers of collagen and elastin and ensure their proper structures. β-1,3-glucan increases the synthesis of the insufficient products in your skin and stimulates the renewal of your skin. Wheat germ, soybean, avocado and shea oils are involved in metabolic processes and provide a regenerating, anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory effect. Membrane lipids and Vitamin F improve the protection properties of your skin by restoring the integrity of its outermost layer.
All the creams provide potent anti-aging treatment for your skin.  The creams are multi-active preparations requiring a course of treatment according to age.

Hi Hyal Active Complex
Injection-free bio-revitalization product.
This unique cosmetic preparation uses several ways of moisturizing simultaneously. High-molecular hyaluronic acid intensively moisturizes the outer layers and makes your skin feel soft and silky. The three components: low molecular hyaluronan, myristyl tripeptide, and exopolysaccharide, all work to stimulate production of body’s own hyaluronic acid in the skin and deep moisturizing.  Myristyl tripeptid also strengthens collagen fibers and restores elasticity and firmness of your skin. Polysaccharides of marine proteobacteria create the ideal environment for holding in water. Lecitin repairs the skin protective barrier and reinforces the moisturizing effect.

UNIQUE PROPERTIES OF ARKADIA COSMETICS
A damaged lipidic barrier can be a cause of pathologically sensitive skin, skin dryness, scaling, and redness.  Arkadia care emulsions are specially designed for sensitive skin.  To make these emulsions, we use skin-related substances (membrane lipids, including glycolipids, phospholipids, lecithin and morphologically similar substances, obtained from natural products).  As these substances are morphologically similar to the skin lipids, they embed into the damaged areas and restore the resisting barrier, relieve pathological sensitivity and normalize the condition of your skin.  Such foundation emulsions are used in premium cosmetics.
The principle function of cellular cosmetics is to stimulate skin to start producing the essential elements. For this, cellular activators are used, which are specific substances influencing the behavior of the cells and activatimg the self-regulation and self-renovation mechanism.  Arkadia cosmetics uses a smooth immunomodulator β−1,3-glucan (a natural polysaccharide, extracted from cell walls of yeasts or grains), which can activate protective cells (macrophages). This helps produce a complex of micronutrients, which stimulate the renewal of the outermost layers of skin cells and collagen synthesis, strengthen capillaries, and produce inflammation regulators (cytokines).
β-1,3-Glucan has a number of exceptional qualities, which make it a highly valuable ingredient for regenerating, rejuvenating, anti-inflammatory, sun-protective and anti-stress cosmetic products.
A professional home treatment includes skin cleansing (facial wash milk or foam, and tonic), protection and moisturizing (daily cream), and nourishing (night cream). The daily use of serums shall enhance and prolong the effect of your home treatment, visibly improving its results.
