UNIQUE PROPERTIES OF ARCADIA COSMETICS
Biocompatibility and Regeneration Properties of Foundation
Protection is the principal function of the skin. The stratum corneum of the skin envelops its main protection mechanism, the epidermal lipids barrier. Any composition, when applied to skin, comes in contact with its stratum corneum, which is its protective barrier. The studies of the structure and of the function of the epidermal barrier, which carried on in the nineties of the previous century, have resulted in understanding that foundations of cosmetics may have tangible effect on the condition of the skin.
For this reason, Arcadia Cosmetics Laboratory creates its creams based on lamellar emulsions. To make these emulsions, we use skin-related substances (membrane lipids, including glycolipids, phospholipids, lecithin, and morphologically similar substances, obtained from natural products), which are compatible with the skin lipids. These substances embed into the damaged areas of the skin and relieve pathological sensitivity.  This makes Arcadia creams perfect for sensitive skin. Even without any additional active components, the lamellar emulsion can vividly improve the skin, because the foundation shall have its effect. Such foundation emulsions are only used in premium cosmetics.
Cellular and Molecular Action Levels
Cosmetics these days does not only maintain and improve the protection function of the skin, but also works on cellular and molecular levels. The principle function of cellular cosmetics is to stimulate skin to start producing the essential components.  For this, cellular activators (cellular modulators) are used, which are specific substances that affect the vital functions of the cells and activate the self-regulation mechanism.  As a result, the skin renews using its own resources; it regenerates.
Arcadia cosmetics uses a smooth immunomodulator β-1,3-glucan (a natural polysaccharide, extracted from cell walls of yeasts or grains using high-technology methods), which can activate protective cells (macrophages).  This helps produce a complex of regulator cells, which stimulate the renewal of the outermost layer of the skin and collagen synthesis, and strengthen capillaries.  β-1,3-glucan has a number of exceptional qualities, which make it a highly valuable ingredient for regenerating, rejuvenating, anti-inflammatory, sun-protective and anti-stress cosmetic products.
To design the products, Arcadia Cosmetics Lab selects the active components according to their synergetic efficiency and functionality, and not for the purposes of marketing. The range of the active ingredients, used in Arcadia cosmetic preparations, is so wide that Arcadia could find its place in any category of cosmetics, be it nano, corneo, peptide, eco cosmetics, or else.
The efficiency of a preparation does not only depend on the list of its active components, but also on how they can penetrate the deep layers of the skin. For example, certain vitamins loose their properties, when they acidify on the surface of the skin, and do not achieve the announced performance. Arcadia Cosmetics Lab has designed a special water-free foundation for certain preparations, which allows using the components in their native state to ensure their maximum efficiency. This is an internationally unique know-how.
 
Cosmetology has long used DMAE. Normally, it is synthetic DMAE, but there is also a plant-extracted analogue. The plant-extracted DMAE is compatible to your skin and is therefore more adjusted to human physiology and nonallergenic.

DMAE is a natural precursor of acetylcholine, which is essential for muscle work and tone. The integrated rejuvenating effect is achieved through the DMAE’s simultaneous action in several directions:
•	it improves skin regeneration and increases the muscle tone
•	it makes your skin firm, smooth, and silky
•	it corrects the face oval
•	it gives your face fresh complexion
•	it breaks and removes toxins and wastes from the body, and increases cell life.
The preparations in this series have an instant and long-lasting lifting effect by acting both on the skin surface and in its deeper layers.
